This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Litecoin, fork of Pooler's CPU miner for Litecoin.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Dependencies:
        libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

        tmalloc         http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/

Basic *nix build instructions:
        ./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
        CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -mmmx -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse -funroll-loops -march=native" ./configure
        make


########### CAUTION ###########
This fork does not have the presumption to be portable (as opposed to the original project https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer). 
Presumably it works on machines (x86, x86_64) with full support for SSE2. In addition, the optimizations have a positive effect on the machines I've tested but nothing prohibits that in other cases are regressions.

Happy hacking.
